# Types

HLF's type system allows you to pass values of a host of different types around.

Builtin types are:

- `Vector`: A 3d-vector
- `BlockType`: A type of block
- `Entity`: A single entity in the world
- `string`: A character sequence
- `int`: An integer value
- `float`: A floating-point value. (_Unfortunately as of now, all float-operations are actually fixed-point operations_)
